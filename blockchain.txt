Getting started with Blockchain Development

-building web application on top of blockchain
-decentralize,transparency and flexibility,speed and effeciency,security and immutability,removal of counterpart risk,trust minimized agreements
-browser>html/css/javascript/react>blockchain(used as backend and server meaning that we can create our business logic and save data on it)
-smart contracts=self-executing building blocks of blockchain that are programs which are immutable
-solidity-language used for writing smart contracts
-infura-an ethereum node in the blockchain for personal use
-ganache-personal blockchian for projects local
-testing
-dapp/decentralized web app
-front end + smart contract
-challenges on blockchain dev=> 1,integration with blockchain/web3/ and 
				2,integration with wallet/private keys for transactions one of it is metamask/
-secret recovery phrase/master key for metamask blockchain
(they deputy skirt boat jealous bubble spend spray corn aware sleep latin)
-testnet-are fake network that have no value but have the same functions as main net
-block explorer/etherscan- application used to show a transactions made in the blockchain
-gas-is a unit of computational measure that more computation a tranction uses the more gas you have to pay for it
   -transctions made on the blockchain have to pay gas fees to node operators
-hash-unique fixed string that is used to identify a piece of data
-genesis block-the first block of the blockchain/has all zero hash
-the hash must be calculated using the block#,nonce,data and previous hash in the block/one of the reasons that it is hard to tamper
-nonce is number used once to find solution to blockchain problem
-different peers are organized in the blockchain that have the same hash and change in data needs to be re calculated/mined to produce the same hash as the others
 peer hashes which will cost gas
-mining is the proces of finding solution in the blockchain problem.
-the data is using tokens and any change in tokens will result in different hash numbers which would differentiate agaianst the other peers
 on the blockchain so that block will be detached/exculded from the chain.
-ethereum works on keccak256 hash algorithm
-the private key is used for signature in a transaction which anyone later verifies the transaction hash from one public key to another public key
 and also the signature cannot derive the private key
-the public key is generated from the private key
-consensus is the mechanism used to agree on state of a blockchain/nakamoto consensus
-sybil resistance=>proof of work(pow) using mining/needs a lot of energy cause every node is racing to a new block/miners
		 =>proof of stake(pos) uses collateral/validators/nodes randomly choose to propose a new block and validated by validators/uses less energy
